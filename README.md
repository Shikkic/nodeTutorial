# Getting Started

### Forking Shikkic/nodeTutorial

First start by forking this repo. You can find the fork button at the top right of the page!

Then lets clone the repo to our desktop so we can make some changes and eventually push it to our heroku server.

Navigate to your Desktop via Git Bash, or terimnal, and enter the following. (EX: C:\Users\Shikkic\Desktop)

>Make sure to insert your username into the url

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAMEHERE/nodeTutorial
```

# Heroku

### Signing up for Heroku

Heroku is going to provide the free hosting for our node server, so if you don't have an account sign up now! 

>Don't worry it's most basic teir is free, so no credit card required!

[Sign up here!](https://signup.heroku.com/www-header)

### Creating our first Heroku node app

After you've logged in you should see a dashboard. Heroku uses what they call **apps** as servers, we can manage the content we upload to them and tell Heroku when to run it. 

We don't have any Heroku apps yet, so why don't we make a new one.

###Great! Now we've connected our app to our servers repo

Our server repo is connected now and anytime we *push* an update to the repo, the changes to our website will be automatically reflected by our server

>Let's test it out and manually push our app to the server from the dashboard
